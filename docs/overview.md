# Goat Show Manager Documentation 🐐

Welcome to the documentation hub for Goat Show Manager.  
This folder contains design notes, specifications, and guides to help maintain and extend the project.

## 📂 Contents
- **Overview** (this file): Project vision and goals
- **Architecture.md**: System design, modules, and data flow
- **DataModel.md**: Goat, Owner, Show, and Judge data structures
- **Workflow.md**: User workflows and application processes
- **Testing.md**: Testing strategy and coverage notes

## 🎯 Project Vision
Goat Show Manager is designed to:
- Provide a clear, scalable system for managing goat shows
- Support accurate record‑keeping for participants and events
- Offer extensible modules for future features (e.g., reporting, analytics)
- Maintain clean, professional code and documentation standards

---

## 🛠 Development Principles
- **Clarity:** Code and docs should be easy to read and understand.
- **Scalability:** Design for growth — new features should fit naturally.
- **Testing:** Every module should include unit tests.
- **Documentation:** Keep this folder updated as the project evolves.

---

## 📜 How to Use This Folder
- Add new `.md` files for specific topics (e.g., database schema, UI design).
- Link them here in the **Contents** section.
- Keep documentation versioned alongside code in GitHub.

---

## 🐐 Next Steps
- Draft `Architecture.md` to outline the initial module structure.
- Define core data models in `DataModel.md`.
- Document the first user workflow (adding goats and registering them for shows).
